# Release Notes


## TODO's yet [see issues for more](https://github.com/davefowler/prosemirror-suggestion-mode/issues)

 - deleting across blocks puts in in their own block
 - make suggestEdit a command
 - find and handle isntances where openStart=1 openEnd=0 or reveersed? is that a thing?
 - handle multiple user suggestions overlapping
 - applySuggestion only works for text matching - a more advanced way would be great.
 - Hover 


## 1.0.20

Big rewrite here as the previous versions only supported the ReplaceStep and only for plain text.

Overall this release enables a lot more functionality while increasing simplicity, mostly by following better (more elegant) prosemirror practices

 - support all transaction step types - ReplaceStep, AddMarkStep, RemoveMarkStep, ReplaceAroundStep
 - replacing slices, not textContent - maintaing any markup in changes
 - all helper functions moved to be prosemirror commands
 - test cases for new step types and edge cases
 - 'basic' example using the prosemirror-example-setup with a toolbar, undo/redo and many formatting options
 - more proper use of prosemirror mark properties and functions like inclusive and 
 - simplified the hover menu to a single decorator widget
 - integrated add/reject buttons into toolbar
 - paragraph pastes working
 - accept and reject suggestion commands are now range based
